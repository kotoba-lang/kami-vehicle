  "Beam -- pairwise spring-damper between two nodes.
   Restored from kami-vehicle (kotoba-lang/kami-engine, deleted PR #82),
   ADR-2607010930.

   A beam reproduces BeamNG semantics:
     F = -k * (L - L0_eff) - d * (dL/dt)

   where `L0_eff` is the *effective* rest length (drifts under plastic
   deformation) and `k`, `d` are the spring stiffness and damping. Beams may
   be `:normal` (always active), `:bounded` (active only between min/max
   ratio), `:hydro` (length is a function of an external control like
   steering), `:pressured` (rest length increases with internal pressure --
   used for tire sidewalls), or `:support` (compression-only, e.g. bump-stop).

   Plastic deformation: when |strain| exceeds `:deform-limit`, `L0_eff`
   follows the current length (yielding). When the strain exceeds
   `:break-limit`, the beam snaps and is removed from the integration.")
